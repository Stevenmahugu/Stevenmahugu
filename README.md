**Hi!** 

I'm Steve. A passionate Machine Learning Engineer from Kenya

Welcome to my Github ‚ú® I'm currently working on various Machine learning | Deep learning | Data Analysis projects. I have pursued my masters degree in Mathematics at UON in Nairobi, Kenya. My B.Sc was in Mathematics and Operations Research, also at UON. I have been teaching professionals virtually about Data Science since 2019. Best way to reach out to me would be at stevenmahugu@gmail.com and https://preply.com/en/tutor/180837.

I mostly operate in private repos, but some are available to the public (or somewhat available üç≥) Reason for this is that some part of my work involve Topological Data Analysis where I use licensed libraries.
